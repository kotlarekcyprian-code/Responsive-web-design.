Title: My Home Office Renovation Plan

Introduction – Why I Need This Room

For a long time, I have dreamed of having my own space to work, think, and create. As a junior game designer, I need a quiet and inspiring place to focus. I also want a room that reflects who I am — a person who loves science, fantasy worlds like The Witcher, traditional pipe smoking, and spending quality time with my wife and daughter. This home office will be more than just a workspace. It will be a place where I can develop ideas, read books, and relax.

Step 1: Planning the Space

Before I start anything, I need a good plan. As someone with an analytical mind, I like to think in steps. First, I measured the room and made a simple sketch on paper. The room is medium-sized, with one window on a wall, another in the roof, and it gets nice sunlight in the afternoon.

I divided the room into three zones:
1. Work Zone – for my computer, desk, and game design materials.
2. Reading Zone – with a comfortable chair and bookshelf.
3. Relaxation Zone – a small corner with a pipe stand and witcher world decorations.

Planning the layout helped me see how much space I really have and what I can fit comfortably. I also made a list of tools and materials I will need during the renovation.

Step 2: Cleaning and Preparing

The second step is to clean everything. I removed old furniture and took down posters and decorations from the previous use of the room. I checked the walls and floor for any damage. There were some small holes in the wall so I patched them with filler.

Step 3: Painting and Walls

The fun part is coming — changing the color of the room. I chose dark blue and soft grey for the walls. The blue color helps me feel focused and calm, and it also reminds me of the night sky — perfect for someone who enjoys astrophysics.
One wall will be a "theme wall" with posters and prints. I plan to frame a large Witcher map and hang it  the reading chair. I will also put up a small shelf for science books and maybe a model of a galaxy or a planet.

Painting took about two days, including drying time. I opened the window and used a fan to keep the air fresh while working.

Step 4: Furniture and Equipment

Once the painting was finished, I started bringing in furniture. The most important piece is the desk. I chose a wide, wooden desk with space for two monitors and a notebook. It has drawers for storing cables, sketchbooks, and small items.

I also added:
- An ergonomic chair for long hours of work.
- A brand new chinese shelf(which I repainted).
- A small cabinet for my pipe collection and tobacco.(glazed)

I installed soft LED lighting around the desk area, so the light is not too harsh. A small desk lamp also helps during nighttime work or reading.

For technology, I set up my computer, keyboard, mouse, and a second monitor for multitasking. I made sure the internet cable was connected directly to avoid slow Wi-Fi issues.

Step 5: Decorating with My Interests

This step is where the room really started to feel like “mine.” I added decorations that show my personality. On the bookshelf, I placed my favorite books — from science authors like Neil deGrasse Tyson  to fantasy novels by Andrzej Sapkowski or Robert Jordan.

I also hung a few small prints from The Witcher games and books, including one of Geralt standing under a full moon — a perfect combination of fantasy and the cosmos.

In one corner, I put my pipe collection with a small wooden stand and a vintage-looking ashtray. The smell of pipe tobacco gives the room a calm, nostalgic feeling. It’s not for everyone, but for me, it’s comforting.

Step 6: Family Corner and Relaxation Area

Even though this is my personal office, I want to share it sometimes with my family. I created a small space with a soft carpet and a bean bag where my daughter can sit and play or draw while I work. It makes me happy when she visits me during the day.
For my wife, I added a second chair next to mine, so she can sit with me while I show her my work or just talk.

This family connection helps me stay grounded and reminds me why I do what I do. Work is important, but it’s not everything.

Step 7: Final Touches

To finish the renovation, I added a few more small touches:
- A clock with a Victorian Railway station design.
- Curtains to match the color of the walls.
- Cable organizers to keep everything tidy.

I also added a whiteboard on one wall where I can write ideas, tasks, or quick notes while designing games.

Finally, I added a plant to bring some life into the room. It's small and easy to care for, but it makes a big difference in atmosphere. I hope that my cat will note eat that.

Conclusion – What This Room Means to Me

When the room will be finished, I will feel proud and excited. This is not just a home office. I imagine it’s a personal space where I can focus on my career as a junior game designer, enjoy my hobbies, and spend quiet moments with my family. It reflects my passions — from science and games to literature and tradition.
